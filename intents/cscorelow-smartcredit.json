I would suggest making sure there is nothing on your credit report that is artificially lowering your score. Though our partnership with Smart Credit you can get a copy of your credit report and file disputes on any wrong information for no additional cost. I recommend you take a look at your credit and hold off on a mortgage loan until your scores are above 680."
